# notes
* This is a repository for my dotfiles. My bar uses Fontawesome 5 and Roboto fonts by default, but you can change that!
* My conky requires [conky draw](https://github.com/fisadev/conky-draw). Go grab that if you want it.
* My compton config is made to work nicely with my Nvidia GPU on the proprietary drivers. It may not be the best for your hardware
