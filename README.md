# i3rice
This is a repository for my dotfiles. It integrates nicely with rhythmbox for audio playing, so if you already use that, have fun.

# setup
This setup uses the Roboto font by default and requires the following dependencies: dunst, light, polybar, compton, i3-gaps, rofi, fontawesome (icon font), feh, tilix, and scrot. If you want to use my conky, you need to go get [conky draw](https://github.com/fisadev/conky-draw) and put all the conky-related files from my repo into ~./conky
