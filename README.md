This is a repository for my dotfiles. To use the included install script (for Ubuntu and derivatives), save it to your home folder and run it from the terminal. I do not suggest running the install script on an install that has any changes made to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini or xorg.conf, as it could overwrite some settings.
