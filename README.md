# i3rice
This is a repository for my dotfiles. My bar uses Fontawesome 5 and Roboto as fonts by default, but you can change that!

# setup
If you would like to use my whole setup, it uses the **Roboto** font by default and requires the following dependencies: dunst, light, polybar, compton, i3-gaps, rofi, fontawesome (icon font), feh, tilix, and scrot. If you want to use my conky, you need to go get [conky draw](https://github.com/fisadev/conky-draw) and put all the conky-related files from my repo into ~./conky

* polybar is to be placed in ~/.config/polybar/

* config is to be placed in ~/.config/i3/

* compton.conf is to be placed in ~/.config/

* dunstrc is to be placed in ~/

* song.sh is to be placed in ~/.config/polybar/

* conkyrc, conky_draw_config.lua and conky_draw.lua are all to be placed in ~/.conky
